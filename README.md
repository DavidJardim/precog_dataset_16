PRECOG Dataset 2016
===============
We used Kinect to record the dataset which contains 8 aggressive actions like punching and kicking, 6 distinct sequences (each sequence contains 5 actions). Recorded 12 subjects, each subject performed 6 sequences. Total of 72 sequences, 360 actions. The data is recorded in .csv format containing only the skeleton data. A visualizing tool was included in the repository. Inside the DataSet folder are all the sequences and a PPT (PRECOG DATASET.pptx) describing the sequences.

(The Kinect SDK V1.8 is required)
